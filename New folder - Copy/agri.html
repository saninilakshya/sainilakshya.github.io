    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Effect on agricultural practices</h1>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">The 2023 southwest monsoon season in India started late, with
            the initial two weeks experiencing a significant rainfall deficiency of 52.6% below the normal long-period
            average(LPA).

            However, as of July 30, 2023 there was an overall 6% surplus rainfall. This turnaround has positively
            impacted kharif crop plantings. However, concerns persist regarding the potential impact of the approaching
            El Nino phenomenon on rabi crops.<a

    <h1>What is the Long-Period Average (LPA) of Rainfall?</h1>
    <p>The IMD defines the "LPA of rainfall" as the average rainfall recorded over a specific region for a long period,
        like 30 or 50 years. Based on this, the IMD classifies rainfall into five categories on an all-India scale:</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Normal or near normal: Rainfall between 96-104% of LPA.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Below normal: Rainfall between 90-96% of LPA.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Above normal: Rainfall between 104-110% of LPA.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Deficient: Rainfall less than 90% of LPA.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Excess: Rainfall more than 110% of LPA.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 style="font-size:42px;">What are Kharif and Rabi Crops?</h1>
    <h2> Kharif Crops:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Kharif crops are sown during the monsoon season, from June to
            October, and harvested in the late summer or early autumn.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">They depend on the southwest monsoon for irrigation and growth.
        </li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Major Kharif crops include rice, maize, sorghum, pearl millet
            (bajra), finger millet (ragi), groundnut and pulses like pigeon pea (arhar) and green gram (moong).</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;"> They account for about 55% of the total foodgrain production
            in India.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rabi Crops:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">These crops are sown around the Retreating Monsoon and
            Northeast monsoon season, which begins in October and are called rabi or winter crops.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">The harvest for these crops happens typically during April and
            May, during the summer season.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Major Rabi crops are wheat, gram, peas, barley etc.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">A warm climate is required for seed germination and cold
            climate for the growth of crops.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1> What is the Impact of Monsoon on Indian Agriculture?</h1>
    <h2> Positive Impacts:</h2>
    <p>Increased Crop Production: A major portion of the country's crop area is completely dependent on Monsoon rains as
        they're not equipped with methods of manual irrigation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Adequate rainfall during the monsoon season leads to increased
            soil moisture and promotes the growth of crops, resulting in higher agricultural output.</li>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">The availability of water supports the cultivation of a variety
            of crops, including rice, wheat, millets, and pulses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Economic Boost: Successful monsoon seasons contribute to rural prosperity by providing income to farmers and
        laborers, which, in turn, stimulates demand for goods and services in the rural economy.</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">This increased economic activity has a positive impact on
            overall national growth.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Recharge of Groundwater: The monsoon helps recharge groundwater resources, which is crucial for sustainable
        agricultural practices in regions where water scarcity is a challenge.</p>
    <h2>Negative Impacts:</h2>
    <p>Erratic Monsoon Patterns: The monsoon's timing, intensity, and distribution are unpredictable, leading to
        uncertainties in agricultural planning and crop management.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Delayed or early monsoons can disrupt planting schedules and
            affect crop yields.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Droughts and Floods: Monsoon failure or excess rainfall can lead to droughts or floods, respectively.</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Both scenarios can be disastrous for agriculture. Droughts
            result in water shortages, crop failures, and reduced yields, while floods can damage crops, wash away
            fertile topsoil, and lead to livestock losses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Crop Losses: Prolonged and excessive monsoon rains can cause crop diseases, reducing crop quality and yield.
        These conditions also hinder farmers' ability to conduct agricultural operations effectively.</p>
    <p>Soil Erosion: Heavy rainfall can lead to soil erosion, which depletes soil fertility and affects agricultural
        productivity in the long run.</p>
    <ul>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Soil erosion also impacts water bodies and can lead to
            siltation in reservoirs, reducing their storage capacity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Food Price Inflation: Inconsistent monsoon patterns can affect crop production and lead to shortages, resulting
        in food price inflation.</p>
    <u>
        <li style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">This can have adverse effects on the economy, especially for
            low-income households that spend a significant portion of their income on food.</li>

    <h1>What is El Nino and La Nina and there Implications on Agriculture?</h1>
    <h2>El Nino:</h2>
    <p>During El Niño, trade winds weaken. Warm water is pushed back east, toward the west coast of the Americas.</p>
    <p>El Niño means Little Boy in Spanish. South American fishermen first noticed periods of unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean in the 1600s. The full name they used was El Niño de Navidad, because El Niño typically peaks around December.</p>
    <p>El Niño can affect our weather significantly. The warmer waters cause the Pacific jet stream to move south of its neutral position. With this shift, areas in the northern U.S. and Canada are dryer and warmer than usual. But in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Southeast, these periods are wetter than usual and have increased flooding.</p>
    <p>El Niño also has a strong effect on marine life off the Pacific coast. During normal conditions, upwelling brings water from the depths to the surface; this water is cold and nutrient rich. During El Niño, upwelling weakens or stops altogether. Without the nutrients from the deep, there are fewer phytoplankton off the coast. This affects fish that eat phytoplankton and, in turn, affects everything that eats fish. The warmer waters can also bring tropical species, like yellowtail and albacore tuna, into areas that are normally too cold.</p>
    <div style="text-align:center;margin-top:40px;"><img style="width:50%" src="vs4.jpg"></div>
    <h2>La Nina:</h2>
    <p>La Niña means Little Girl in Spanish. La Niña is also sometimes called El Viejo, anti-El Niño, or simply "a cold
        event." La Niña has the opposite effect of El Niño. During La Niña events, trade winds are even stronger than
        usual, pushing more warm water toward Asia. Off the west coast of the Americas, upwelling increases, bringing
        cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface.</p>
    <p>These cold waters in the Pacific push the jet stream northward. This tends to lead to drought in the southern
        U.S. and heavy rains and flooding in the Pacific Northwest and Canada. During a La Niña year, winter
        temperatures are warmer than normal in the South and cooler than normal in the North. La Niña can also lead to a
        more severe hurricane season.</p>
        <p>During La Niña, waters off the Pacific coast are colder and contain more nutrients than usual. This environment
        supports more marine life and attracts more cold-water species, like squid and salmon, to places like the
        California coast.<a
