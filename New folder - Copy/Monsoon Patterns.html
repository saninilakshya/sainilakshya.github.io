    <h1 style="font-size:45px;">Monsoon Pattern and What is the Changing Monsoon Patterns?</h1>
    <P style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">A monsoon is a seasonal change in the direction of the prevailing,
        or strongest, winds of a region. Monsoons cause wet and dry seasons throughout much of the tropics. Monsoons are
        most often associated with the Indian Ocean. Monsoons always blow from cold to warm regions.<br>Monsoon
        withdrawal begins with the cessation of rainfall activity over northwest India for five straight days, an
        anticyclone establishing itself in the lower troposphere and a marked reduction in moisture content.<br>
        Withdrawal starts from the last State where monsoon reaches, which is Rajasthan.
        Withdrawal season continues from mid-September to almost end of October.<br> It is then replaced by the
        retreating, or northeast monsoon in November.<br>The date for monsoon withdrawal has been corrected to September
        17.

        Below average rainfall is expected over most of India in September. The monsoon 2023 forecast for the month has
        suggested that 32 out of 36 meteorological subdivisions will report below-average rainfall. Cumulatively, the
        rainfall is expected to be 20 millimetres below the 1996-2013 average.

        The forecast — carried out by Akshay Deoras, climate scientist at the University of Reading, the United Kingdom
        — took stock of three climate models (UK Meteorological Office, European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
        Forecasts and National Centers for Environmental Prediction) and combined them to get mean values.</P>

    <P style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">According to Deoras, the impact of El Nino climate pattern is
        palpable.

        El Nino and La Nina are the warm phase and cool phases of a recurring climate pattern across the tropical
        Pacific Ocean called the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. La Nina ended its three-year run this year and El Nino
        announced its arrival.

        “This is a clear impact of the developing El Nino and the lack of favourable intraseasonal weather patterns that
        boost monsoon rainfall (rainfall in July 2023). This is allowing the penetration of dry air from the regions to
        the west of India, such as Pakistan,” Deoras said.

        However, Deoras expressed caution, as there are no clear indications if these intraseasonal weather patterns
        will remain weak or absent throughout the entirety of September.

        “There is, however, an indication of this happening (the absence of intraseasonal weather patterns) during the
        first fortnight of September, so the rainfall deficit across the country appears highly likely in this period,”
        Deoras said.

        The all-India weighted average rainfall for southwest monsoon 2023 is likely going to be below average or 96
        percent below the long-period average of 1971 to 2020, said the climate cientist.<a
