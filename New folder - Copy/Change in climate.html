    <h1 style="font-size:48px;">Climate Change.</h1>
    <p style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Climate is not the same as weather, but the two phenomena are
        closely related. While weather refers to short-term conditions that can change quickly, climate determines the
        long-term character of a given place, for instance, whether it is temperate or tropical. The relationship
        between weather and climate is crucial: the former is subordinate to the latter. Climate determines
        temperatures, weather diversity, the traits of winters, rainfall totals, as well as the nature of meteorological
        phenomena such as the severity of storms. It is due to this delicate relationship that we are facing both
        temperature rises and more frequent weather extremes and natural disasters as a result of climate change.<a

    <h1 style="font-size:45px;">Unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases</h1>
    <p style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;"> Levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere – the
        primary drivers of human-induced climate change – are at record levels and continue to rise.

        Satellites are used to detect the smallest change in atmospheric concentration. They show carbon dioxide rose to
        407 ppm in 2018, while methane concentrations are now around 150% above pre-industrial levels (Buchwitz, M. et
        al. 2018) – and continue to rise.<br>

        By accurately detecting these small changes – to within 1 part per million for carbon dioxide – satellite
        observations are helping the scientific community to improve global climate models and better predict the likely
        warming effect and impacts resulting from increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br>

        ESA's Climate Change Initiative Greenhouse Gas project is mapping the global distribution of near-surface carbon
        dioxide and methane. The team undertaking research to improve on the current operational products initially
        developed by the Climate Change Initiative, but now transferred and extended annually by the EU’s Copernicus
        Climate Change Service.

    <P style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">The project team is using data from the latest generation of
        satellites, including the Copernicus Sentinel-5P mission, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2), and the
        China National Space Administration’s TanSat mission to observe these greenhouse gases in the greatest detail
        yet. <br>These satellites provide even higher resolution data and are equipped with the ability to distinguish
        between natural and human sources of carbon dioxide and methane and in turn support emissions reduction policies
        such as the Paris Agreement that are addressing global warming.

    <h1 style="font-size:45px;">Shrinking of the cryosphere is widespread</h1>
    <p style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;"> The cryosphere – the areas on Earth where water is frozen – plays
        an important role in moderating global climate.

        Global warming has led to a widespread shrinking of the cryosphere in recent decades, across the polar ice
        sheets and glaciers, terrestrial snow cover, Arctic sea ice extent and thickness, with permafrost temperatures
        rising too, according to a recent report by the IPCC (IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a
        Changing Climate, 2019).

        In these often vast, remote areas, satellites have provided crucial insights into the rapid changes underway.

    <h1 style="font-size:45px;">Changing Ice sheets</h1>
    <p style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;"> Polar ice-sheets store more than 99% of Earth’s freshwater ice on
        land. Even modest changes can influence global sea level, increase coastal flooding, and disturb oceanic
        currents.

        Both the Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets are changing rapidly. A recent ESA / NASA funded international
        assessment shows they are losing ice mass six times faster than in the 1990s – a rate that is currently tracking
        the IPCC’s high end climate warming scenario (IMBIE Shepherd, A. et al., 2020).</p>

    <img style="width:50%" src="SV2.png">
    <P style="font-size:25px; margin-bottom: 40px;">Total combined loss of ice mass across Greenland and Antarctica is
        estimated at 6.4 trillion tonnes between 1992 and 2017 – pushing global sea levels up by 17.8 millimetres.<br>

        Of the total sea level rise coming from melting polar ice sheets, around 60% (10.6 millimetres) was due to
        Greenland ice losses and 40% was due to Antarctica (7.2 millimetres).<br>

        Using satellite data scientists estimate that polar ice sheets are responsible for a third of all sea level
        rise.<a
